FoodX AI Order Prediction:
FoodX is an exciting food truck line running a promotion on college campuses. To enhance the user experience, we're leveraging AI to predict the food orders of students based on their provided college information.

Data Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
Year: The academic year of the student.
Major: The major subject of the student.
University: The name of the university.
Time: Time of the order.
Order: The food item ordered by the student.

Exploratory Data Analysis
I performed preliminary data analysis to understand the distributions and biases of the data. The analysis includes:
Distribution of Majors, University, and Year.
Popular food items across different Majors or Universities.
Order trends across different times of the day.

I have used DecisionTreeClassifier as our model to predict the food orders of students based on their college information.
